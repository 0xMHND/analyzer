Choose your example OCR program of choice.
COPY (not move) its source and config file in this directory.

Run:
	python3 add_prints.py <ocr_filename>

This will add print statements in source file where needed.
THE .c FILE WILL BE MODIFIED

Define the absolute path to your xstack clone-root:
	export CLONE_ROOT=<YourPathHere>
(The xstack clone-root should contain folders named "ocr" and "apps")

Run OCR program:
	make -f Makefile.<OCR_TYPE> run
(only OCR_TYPE=x86 support at the moment)
